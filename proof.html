It was the last before your big piece is due and you are a little nervous and a lot stressed about it. Going home and getting some work done should be your priority but you just need something to distract you.
How about the city, you are already here after all? A nice walk down Swanston street should be enough to clear your mind. 
You start to walk and you pass a group of international students on their phones, a business man smoking while talking loudly on his phone and a homeless man propped up on the side of a building, crutches beside him.

You feel a tap on your shoulder.
[[Turn around-&gt;Turn around]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Homeless Man" tags="" position="344,206" size="100,100">This man is slumped against this building. He is wearing a brown duster, or perhaps it's brown because it is caked in mud. You notice that it is so caked in mud that little green plants are growing on it.
He looks up at you from under his hat and his eyes must be the most green you've ever seen.
[[Keep looking-&gt;Pan's Eyes]]
[[Walk away-&gt;Keep walking]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Turn around" tags="" position="66,368" size="100,100">It's the homeless man his green eyes bore into yours. He stands with the help of his crutches. You struggle to look away from his eyes though, they give you no choice.
[[Keep looking-&gt;Pan's Eyes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Pan&#39;s Eyes" tags="" position="201,273" size="100,100">His eyes are so green they are like looking into a forest. Moss between your toes, ferns lick your face, birds sing from high a top the trees. His eyes scrunch as he smiles and you break your eye contact.
You look around, you are still in the city but it's different. Everything is green. A thick layer of grass, dirt and moss covers the stone pavement and the road, even the tram tracks have little mushrooms peppered in their groves. The buildings around you are covered in vines and leaves so thick only their vague shape gives you any indictation that they are still underneath. The neatly groomed city trees have grown out of control covering the sky with their leaves and branches, like giants they tower over you.
Everyone on the street has frozen in time.
You look back at the homeless man, he is still smiling at you. "Desperate times call for desperate measures I suppose. I think you'll do just fine."
You look at him confused, "what is this?"
He just shakes his head, "hate me, love me I'm just doing my job, good luck with your assignment though it won't matter. Never has, never will"
He winks at you.
Suddenly everything is back to normal, no more birds and branches swaying in the forest breeze, the hustle and bustle of the city is back.
The homeless man is just gone. You look all around but he is no where to be seen. 

The others are behaving like normal though too normal.

"Did you see any of that?" You ask.
"See what?" he squints at you like you're crazy, maybe you are. 
Either way he clearly didn't see what happened.

They shake their heads and move away slightly. Not only did they not see anything now they think you're crazy.
[[Business Man-&gt;Business Man After]]
[[Go Home-&gt;Go home]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Go home" tags="" position="83,515" size="100,100">It seems that you are the only one who saw anything. Did you imagine it or was that man really there? Either way he is gone now so it doesn't matter.
You are now sufficiently distracted from uni and it's time to go home and finish that assignment. You turn around and walk into Melbourne Central. Ignoring the allure of all of the stores you travel down to the train station and catch your train out to your home.
Completing your assignment is a bit difficult with the strange event of the day capturing your attention when you need it most, but you manage to submit it. Not your best work but it's done.
Your sleep is somewhat fitful as your imagination runs wild with what it's given.
You wake the next morning and you have uni again. It worries you yet what are the chances of running into the same man two times in a row, if he even is real.
You get ready to go to your next class. You pull on your shoes, the same shoes as yesterday and you notice they're dirty. Dried mud crumbles off them. 
You're running late so you don't have time to fully process that. You rush out of the door and to the train station.
The train is pretty empty, perks of uni starting at strange times, no rush hour. But as you sit down you're forced to look at your shoes. They are dirty. You live in the suburbs and walk on the pavement. You went to the city yesterday not the mountains. Though your mind reaches for any other explaination you know there is only one. If the dried mud is real therefore... 
The train pulls into Melbourne Central Station. You get off and begin the winding journey out of the dungeon that is Melbourne Central. Everything seems so normal, too normal. A pack of lads are arguing with a security guard, a mother is dragging her screaming and crying child away from EB games and uni students stand around sipping expensive coffee. But while you walk you can feel the crunch of the dried mud. 
You step out onto Swanston street and there he is again. You freeze for a moment and watch him. He is looking down at the ground, his face covered by his hat. It doesn't look like he has noticed you.
[[Walk Away-&gt;Walk away]]
[[Walk toward him-&gt;Walk Toward Pan]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Walk Toward Pan" tags="" position="299,478" size="100,100">You need answers. You march toward him but he seen you coming and looks up at you from under his hat.
You demand answers.
"What did you do?"
He stands up, hat covering those green eyes but you can still see a playful smirk play around his face. He steps toward you and he is close. You can smell that familar scent of the forest on him or rather it is him.
His eyes have a playful sparkle, it's chaotic and elaborate.
[[Panic-&gt;Bite]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Walk away" tags="" position="213,591" size="100,100">You're scared. You don't know what this man will do this time so you walk away he hasn't noticed you anyway. You just need to get to your class, that's all. You'll be safe there in the normal world. 
You look back over your shoulder as you approach La Trobe street. He isn't sitting in his spot anymore. Panic flutters through you and you scan around the area. He is nowhere to be seen.
The lights change and people start to walk around you. You turn back around ready to just go to class. 
There he is. Right in front of you.
He smiles down at you.
[[Panic-&gt;Bite]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Bite" tags="" position="361,625" size="100,100">There is a strong grip on your wrist. He has grabbed you. This man is not as frail as he appears. You struggle against it but it's too strong. You look back up into his eyes. He gives you a smirk before launching forth. 
He pulls you closer but his head snaps toward you neck and suddenly you feel a piercing pain in your neck. You feel the warmth of blood. His teeth tear into your flesh.
He lets go and you fall, your vision is failing, fading. You hit the pavement hard but it's nothing compared to the searing pain in your neck. This pain travels down your body until everything feels like it's on fire.
As your consciousness starts to drift you hear him say, "meow for now."
The last thing you see is that smile before everything turns [[black.-&gt;Pain]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Pain" tags="" position="509,577" size="100,100">Everything hurts, your entire body and soul. It all hurts. It burns.
Nothing has been more painful.
Nothing is broken, nothing is wrong.
It's just pain like you have never experienced. 
Pain that brings forth change.
[[Everything hurts-&gt;Wake up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Wake up" tags="" position="692,569" size="100,100">Birds.
Their songs travel over the forest,
In order to communicate with each other,
With everything.
The warm breeze caresses your face and rustles the leaves in the wind. You open your eyes just a crack and you see blue. It's bright but there isn't just blue, there are leaves. The tops of branches. A Rosella eyes you supsciously it's little black eye trained on you, it's red and blue feathers sleek against it's body.
You're alive. 
You sit up, all that pain you had experienced is gone. You feel fine. More than fine, your senses are heightened. You feel stronger. You look at your body, there is nothing broken, your clothing is just a little dirty but as you inspect your shoulder there is a black mark. Inspecting it closer you find it is the silhouette of a big cat on the prowl, perhaps a lioness or a leopard. You run a finger over it, it's not a tattoo it seems to be part of your skin. That is the only thing you can find that is different.
It is strange though that is not important, you look around. You're in the forest. You can't be certian. But you assume it's the dark forest. 
This forest is to the east of Melbourne, coming up close to the inner eastern surburbs like Richmond and Hawthorn. It is considered a national park though it is rarely travelled within. Something about too many snakes. It has been a constant in your life in Melbourne but now that you think about it, it's a little strange that such a big forest was left untouched by a huge city. It is just left alone even by greedy logging companies and those wanting to expand the city.
Again you can't be sure that is where you are but you have a suspicion. You also can't be sure how far away you are from civilisation. 
You look into your bag. Your lunch is there and your water bottle, as well as your laptop, wallet, pens, note book, keys, scarf, mints, and your phone is in your pocket.
That might get you through the day but you have no idea however far away you are, and what is more important... which direction?
You pull out your phone. No reception. Not a good sign but the compass. That works. Assuming you are in the Dark Forest. West is most likely to take you back to Melbourne. East will be further into the forest. But which will be the quickest route? That depends on where you are in the forest and since there is no way of knowing all that is left is to pick one and hope for the best.

After all the north dominates the forest more than the south does. You hope that you will end up in a suburb like Ivanhoe or Heidelberg.
As you walk the forest becomes a little more thin and there is less bark on the ground, that has to be a good sign right?
Still every sound coming from within the dark depths makes you jump.
[[Continue walking-&gt;Sound]]
&lt;audio src="./audio/Forest1.mp3" autoplay loop /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="West" tags="" position="830,558" size="100,100">You point your phone in the direction of west and begin to walk. Bark litters the ground you have to step over it but you move quickly. There is no clear path through the forest as you walk so you just follow the compass. Light starts to stream through the trees.
You walk for about an hour and you come to a path it leads west. You stop and think about it for a second, does this mean that you are close enough to Melbourne that humans are here or is it something else? 
[[Path-&gt;Path ]]
[[South West-&gt;South West]]
[[North West-&gt;North West]]
&lt;audio src="./audio/Forest4.mp3" autoplay loop /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="South West" tags="" position="676,401" size="100,100">You point your phone, the compass, in the direction of South West and start to walk. Though Dark Forest seemed like a simplistic name but so little sun light streams through it is really dark. You start to recall the news stories of missing people and people finding their deaths within the forest. Suddenly it's not just snakes you are watching out for.
You step over fallen bark as you try your best to rush through the forest. If you keep on this path you hope that you will end up in Oakleigh or perhaps Brighton.
There is a small rustle in the leaves behind you. It could just be the wind or maybe it's something else.
Better to see the wind than to miss something important.
Turning you see a small glimmer of light, it's not sun light, no that has been blocked out by the towering trees. It's another sorce of light. Perhaps another person.
You walk over to it and brush the fern's fronds. You see a little floating light. Something you would usually dismiss as a trick of the light but right there before your eyes there is a fairy, a small fae lady with the tiniest pointed ears and butterfly wings fluttering at her back.
She smiles at you but notices you can see her. Her expression turns to surprize and she flutters backward, "You can see me?"

[[Yes, I think so.-&gt;Yes - good]]

You keep walking, wondering what else you could find in this forest. Eventually you come across a [[path-&gt;Path ]].

Getting a closer look at her you can see her clothing is made quite literally out of the forest, leaves and bark. She is beautiful and delicate but she look at you with pity like you are the fagile one.
She reaches into the pouch that she carries and tosses something that seems vaguely like glitter but inconporeal at you. It disappears as it hits you, tingling a little.
"What was that?" You ask.
"Pixie dust," she flutters up to your face, "You seem lost and I wanted to help you. That is the path you need to take."
She points in a direction, it just seems like trees to you. When you look back at her to thank her she is gone.
[[Go in that direction-&gt;Sound]]

It seems to be somewhat well used. There isn't a thick layer of leaves and bark which makes it distinctly different and much easier to walk through.
Could this be a walking track? 
You hope so, walking tracks only exist on the very edge of the forest. However when you listen all you can hear is the trees and birds, no people, cars or any other signs of Melbourne.
So what else might use this track?
You don't really want to think about that considering how wide this is.
Eventually you come to a clearing, there are trees around the edges but it seems there are only rocks, moss and grass here. Strange. However the path stops here, this seems like the destination.
[[Look around -&gt;Dwarven Melbourne Entry]]

&lt;audio src="./audio/Forest3.mp3" autoplay loop /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Sound" tags="" position="468,726" size="100,100">As you walk the trees are rustling around you. It makes you jump a little, it's very dark but you're completely alert. Despite the fear the forest softens you with its beauty. It's a wonder why no one goes exploring this forst. If it weren't so dark you would take out your phone and take some pictures. 
There is another rush of wind through the trees but this time you can hear something. Bark crackling underfoot.
Something is behind you.

You can feel a certian kind of aura from them. 
There are bigger ones, some that stand even taller than you. However looking at the ground you can see rock covers the surface of it, very flush with the ground. There is a big circlar part that is covered in thick moss. Looking closer at that section, you see something engraved into the rock. You pull back the moss and see that it is indeed engraved. 
The letters look like no earthly langauge you've seen before. Rough runes are chipped into the rock. As you pull back more of the moss your hand grazes the runes. Suddenly they glow a soft orange as if they were lit from within.
Suddenly one of the taller rocks cracks and an entry, similar size to a doorway opens. You can see it's an opening to some kind of tunnel.
[[Enter-&gt;Dwarven Melbourne]]
[[Walk away-&gt;Sound]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Dwarven Melbourne" tags="" position="865,32" size="100,100">Even though you are scared you walk into the passage way. Strangely it's not as dark as what you thought it would be. Though there are no lights you can see perfectly fine. You look down at your clothes, which are black like any normal Melbournian but it seems like everything is in black and white. You can tell it is supposed to be dark. But you can see all the texture of this tunnel. 
You can see in the dark.
After only a few minutes of walking there is light at the end of the tunnel. Haha. You look back down at your clothing and the colour has come back to it.
You walk toward the light. Haha. As you walk to the end of the tunnel it takes a while for your eyes to adjust to the bright light.
When your eyes adjust you can barely believe what you can see. 
It is a city underground. There is a massive doomed ceiling over it all, with what seems like a projection of the sky and a massive fiery glowing sun in the centre. At the very end of the city there is a palace carved into the edge of the cave. The city you could spend forever looking at. There are so many different types of buildings, some are crumbling and look ancient and right next to some of those there are building so funturistic you can't concieve how they were built and there are all kinds of buildings inbetween. There are lots of people walking through the streets. They all look so unique, lots of wild hair colours and armour, so much armour, people wearing long skirts, robes and armour so small it looks like a bikini. So much variety of people.
You could stand there all day but the temptation to explore overides it. You step down off the lip of the tunnel and walk down the stairs onto the street of this magical city. You notice there are sereval other entrances. 
As you step onto the pavement of the city you notice that it is the same as the Melbourne you know, the smooth dark bluestone that makes up those busy streets, but who copied who?
You begin to walk through the city not really picking a direction to go down just admiring everything. You are in what seems to be a warehouse district of the city. A few people walk past, not really paying too much attention to you but one approaches you.
A woman with bright red hair. Though unlike the dyed hair you've seen before her eyebrows are red as well. This strange hair colour is natural to her and she has an aura of power. She smiles at you.
"Hello you look a little lost."
[[It's my first time here.-&gt;First time]]

[[Over there-&gt;Point]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Point" tags="" position="1213,128" size="100,100">She looks in the direction you pointed. She is trying to look composed but you see a twinge of a smile curling at the ends of her lips. She walks off.
Just to be sure you go in the direction you pointed. When you look over your shoulder she is gone, it's unerving but at least she isn't there anymore.
You keep walking and you find another street, walking down this street you notice it's quieter than the last.
You hear a single foot step then suddenly there is a loud boom and you are struck, you feel energy course though your body and you fall to the ground.
You feel scorched and you can't move anything.
The woman walks into your view as your eyes start to close and the last thing you see is her stamping on your face.

[[Start again?-&gt;Beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Stupid" tags="" position="1255,6" size="100,100">"Well ok then," She smiles at you again, "this is not the nicest place to start your first time here, let me show you the more beautiful areas."
She leads you down another street, this one looks similar to the last but the building at the end is exceptionally old. You walk toward it.

Behind you is a big hulking monster, it has the body of a rhino but so many teeth. Way too many but by far the worst thing is its eyes. They look like shattered glass. 
It charges at you, teeth ready to catch you.
You duck out of the way with insanely quick reflexes. 
It doesn't stop there it turns and rushes at you again.

You clench your fist and throw it as hard as you can right into its face as it tries to bite you, your fist connects. 
But something completely unexpected happens.
As you follow through with your punch the monster is thrown. Its whole body rocks with force, stopping it in its tracks. 
It roars in pain and snaps back at you again. Even though the sudden pain seemed to be suprising to it.
You are caught between its powerful jaws again.
[[Punch it again-&gt;Devil]]

Jaws close around your waist.
It bites down.

[[Start Again-&gt;Beginning]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Devil" tags="" position="172,985" size="100,100">You struggle against the monster, flailing around. Using any limb to try and break free but it's not working. Its grip on you is insanely strong. You're not getting out of this one.
Its many teeth dig down into your side and you can feel blood trickling out as the pressure on your bones gets stronger. They are at breaking point. 
Though despite the pain you are still conscious. 
A bone in your leg snaps and it's so excruciating you scream out in pain. The fire ripples through your body and yet you remain conscious. It is torture, is this what the man has done to you? Can you not die but feel all the agony of dying.
You punch and scratch at its eyes as one last attempt at getting free. It doesn't lose its grip but instead whacks your upper body into a nearby tree repeatedly.
With each strike you can hear a crack, you're not sure if it's you or the tree perhaps both. Probably both.
Heat sears across your face.
You assume it's from the blood or something. But it's too intense.
As the monster brings you back up for another strike you see a controlled explosion of fire strike into its flank.
It spits you out, discarding you as it twists around to find another threat.
You're in too much pain to do anything but you can watch.
The monster scans around with its shattered glass eyes looking for the source of the attack. 
You see an extremely buff woman emerge from the forest. She looks like a female body builder and has a bright orange pixie cut. But more importantly she has a ball of fire surrounding one of her hands and a sword in the other.
"You ugly bastard!" She yells at the monster before charging at it.
First she launches the fireball into its face. It roars and twists in pain. While it is blinded and distracted she draws a second sword and stabs the beast in the neck with both of her swords. They tear right through the flesh with expert precision and you assume, brute strength. It tries to snap at her with its jaws but the movement only opens the wound further. Blood is gushing out all over the woman. Though she doesn't seem to mind, she keeps her swords plundged into its neck and pushes back its snapping jaws with a knee.
Eventually it is felled.
A big heep of flesh that falls to the ground in a thud. The woman pulls her swords from the dying monster and sheaves them as she walks toward you.
She gives a little bit of a smirk seeing you in this state, "Got mixed up with a demon ay?"
[[A demon?-&gt;Demon]]
[[Help me I'm in so much pain.-&gt;whining]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Demon" tags="" position="94,1146" size="100,100">"Yeah a demon duh," she says and upon seeing your confused look she huffs, "look I'm not the brightest either but it's pretty damn obvious. Demons always have those eyes that look like shattered glass. Don't matter what form they're in that's the one tell. Someone should have told you that."
"Someone should have told me a lot of things," you mumble.
She looks at you intently, "What do you mean?"
[[Explain what happened to you-&gt;Explaination Devil]]

She carefully examines your bite mark. She frowns then smiles.
"Looks like you're healing pretty quick. I can't heal that quick," she is pointing at a certian part of the wound.
You look down at it and as she says, it's starting to close. Everything is starting to repair itself. More than that you are starting to feel a little bit better.
"I can take you somewhere safer if you'd like?" She offers.
[[Accept her offer.-&gt;Enroute to Hotel]]
[[Deny her offer.-&gt;Deny offer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Enroute to Hotel" tags="" position="357,1254" size="100,100">She helps you to your feet. "I'm not the brightest person but even I can tell that you are decently powerful with that kind of healing."
You stand up and you're a little unsteady but it's not that bad. You can walk at least. She looks at you curiously.
"The name's Devil, what's yours?" she asks.
You give her your name and she nods then starts to walk.
You follow her, she's fast so you can't quite keep up but you can still keep sight of her in this forest.
This Forest.
Everything seems to make so much more sense now. Any normal human who walked into this forest could get torn to pieces by that demon. You assume there are probably more of them out there and seeing what Devil was capible of, much worse. How did all this happen, is it something new? Or was it always like this?
Your head is swarming with questions and the only hope is where ever Devil is taking you. 
But first comes the walking.
You notice that it's much easier to walk now. The pain is subsiding a lot, enough that you can function but not quite enough that it doesn't hurt.
You catch up with Devil and she looks at you.
"You're lucky you know," she grumbles.
"I really don't think so."
She steps a few paces ahead of you, "You're not far from the mortal world is what I mean."
You catch up to her and underfoot you hear a crunch. You look down at your feet. Gravel. This is a walking trail. Devil gives you a smart ass look and keeps walking and you follow her.
It takes what you guess is about an hour and you come to a campsite. Now that the sky is more visable you can tell that the sun is setting. Lucky there is no one around to gawk at the blood on your clothing. 
Devil turns and looks at you seeing the bloody and ripped shirt you are wearing.
"Ok so it's just down the road so," she takes off her shirt and chucks it at you. Underneath she is wearing a white singlet.
You catch it, it's dirty and sweaty but there is no other choice. You put it on. It's a little loose.
Devil walks off again and you follow along. You come to a street. It's suburban but despite the houses you can still hear the call of the forest that looms behind the red brick houses.
Devil stops in front of one it's extremely average looking. Cream paint over bricks, brown shingles atop the roof. You look at her.
[[This is where I'm going to find the answers?-&gt;Hotel intro]]
[[In here?-&gt;Hotel intro]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Deny offer" tags="" position="507,864" size="100,100">She shrugs at you, "That's cool see you around."
She helps to sit you up and then walks off back into the forest. You are alone once again.
That woman saved your life and you feel lucky about that. But you need to get back to the real world and out of this cursed forest.
You sit and watch the branches sway in the wind for a while until your body feels strong enough to walk. 
You eat your lunch and are greatful that your backpack survived this.
Eventually the wounds are healed, or at least healed enough for you to walk. You stand up and start to walk. It's a little painful but it's ok.
As you keep walking though the forest you come to a clearing full of rocks. You're in a little bit of pain so you decide to pause and look around.
Firstly you notice that the rocks seem... a little... unatural.
You can feel a certian kind of aura from them.
There are bigger ones, some that stand even taller than you. However looking at the ground you can see rock covers the surface of it, very flush with the ground. There is a big circlar part that is covered in thick moss. Looking closer at that section, you see something engraved into the rock. You pull back the moss and see that it is indeed engraved.
The letters look like no earthly langauge you've seen before. Rough runes are chipped into the rock. As you pull back more of the moss your hand grazes the runes. Suddenly they glow a soft orange as if they were lit from within.
Suddenly one of the taller rocks cracks and a entry, similar size to a doorway opens. You can see it's an opening to some kind of tunnel.
Curiousity washes over you. There doesn't seem to be another option.
You enter the tunnel.[[You enter the tunnel.-&gt;Dwarven Melbourne]]

When you finish she points at your wound, "ok firstly you're already starting to heal which is good."
You look down at the wound and she is correct, it's starting to heal itself and very quickly but you look back up at her.
"Look Imma be honest. I'm not the most knowedgeble person but I can take you to some pretty smart people, how about that? They could give you a hand with all this?" she offers.
[[Accept her offer-&gt;Enroute to Hotel]]
[[Deny her offer-&gt;Deny offer]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Hotel intro" tags="" position="135,1453" size="100,100">"Yes smartass, but save your judgement," Devil walks over the driveway and up to the veranda. You follow her.
She grabs a key out of pocket and unlocks the door. 
You walk into a hallway, from what you can see it goes on really far. Way further than what you guessed the dimensions of the house to be. At the end of this hallway there is a lift.
Devil walks further into the place and up to what looks like a lobby for a hotel. She walks up to the desk and so do you.
The woman sitting behind the desk has her nose burried in a book. She has her hair done up so tightly it gives her a face lift.
"Natasha 'round?" Devil asks her.
The woman sighs, closes her book and looks up at Devil. She then turns her gaze on you. She aims her pointed gaze at every single flaw in your clothing.
"What did you drag in?" Her voice is exactly what you would imagine it sounding like.
"Dunno. That's why I need Natasha." 
The woman sighs again as if this is a big effort, "wait over there I'll get her for you."
Her eyes flick to some very modern looking couches. You and Devil sit on them. 
Style not comfort.
It's as if this woman wanted those who bother her to be just as bothered. 
You look at Devil and she is picking things out of her nails.
After shifting uncomfortably a few times finally you hear foot steps. They clomp down the hallway.
Devil perks up at that sound.
A girl comes around the corner. She is wearing purple and black head to toe. Big platform boots and for a reason. You guess she probably wouldn't be over 150cm. She is frail but has a sparkle in her purple eyes.
Both of you stand up.
She smiles at you both, "Devil?"
"Yeah so I found this one getting the shit kicked out of them by a demon," she slaps a hand down on your shoulder. It hurts.
Natasha looks at you, tilting her head to the side, "That's strange."
[[What is it?-&gt;Werecat explaination]]

She leads both you and Devil down the hall and opens one of the many doors.
A small simple room with a table and a couple of chairs.
Natasha closes the door quietly behind herself.
She looks up at you and she looks deeply concerned.
Devil clocks that look, "What is it?"
Natasha looks at her, "Well you know how we got that mortal TV installed with the news playing 24/7?"
"Yeah."
"Well there was this report I was investigating to see if it had anything to do with the vampires and... Look I'll just show you."
Natasha pulls out an ipad and shows Devil.
Devil's face falls and she avoids your gaze.
"What does this mean?" she asks.
Natasha looks to you, "This is a little distrubing are you sure you want to know this part, I can just tell you what you are if you'd like to be spared from the graphic details?"
[[I want to know everything.-&gt;News report]]
[[I just want to know what I am.-&gt;Truth]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="News report" tags="" position="342,1574" size="100,100">Devil hands you the ipad.
It's an article, a head line of a major newspaper. 
Body found on Swanson street. Rushed to St Vincent's Hospital. No signs of life. 
But what is more disturbing is: It's your body.
Your name.
Your family interviewed, mourning.
You are dead, at least in the eyes of everyone you love.
[[What does this all mean?-&gt;Truth]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Truth" tags="" position="559,1598" size="100,100">"Know that you can never return home," Natasha's voice is full of compassion.
"Sorry about that," Devil claps you on the shoulder again, it hurts but you barely feel the pain.
"Despite this I do believe I know what has happened to you," Natasha takes the ipad and pulls up a photo she zooms into the crowd on Swanston street. There he is, the homeless man who bit you. Natasha zooms in and you can see those green eyes.
"That guy," You manage.
"So you saw him?" She looks at you.
"More than saw him, he fricking bit me."
Natasha looks shocked.
"Yeah I know it's a bit weird isn't it," Devil butts in.
Natasha blinks a few times, "This is Pan. This man right here is the god of the wild."
"Pan?" Devil exclaims.
Natasha looks at you, "so he bit you and you blacked out I assume, did you find a new... birthmark?"
You pull back the shirt and reveal the black cat.
Natasha runs her finger over the silhouette, "Pan doesn't really interact with mortals that much. He barely even reveals himself to myths. He is probably the most difficult god to track down. But there is one job that Pan does that involves mortals. Making new werecats."
Devil smiles, "good for you."
"Werecats are much like they sound. They turn into giant cats, much like werewolves. But there are only six in existence, one of each at any given point in time. Tiger, Lion, Leopard, Cheetah, Puma and Lion. They are also known as one of the most powerful myths in existance. Some say they are second only to the gods themselves."
"Way to go," Devil tries to hype you up.
"So now that you know the truth but you have no where else do go would you like to stay here? This is the Hotel. Though it's not actually a hotel. It's a place that myths can stay if they have no where else to go and also will agree to protect mortals from suffering the same fates as we do."
You think about it, there is truly no where else to turn. You're new to this mythical world. Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing. You're at least tired so a good night sleep would do wonders. In the long term perhaps you'd do something else.
"I would like to stay," You tell them.
"Awesome," Natasha smiles, "we will talk to Leah to get you a room."
The three of you leave and walk back into the lobby. Leah doesn't look up.
"We will be needing a new room," Natasha gives her best smile.
"Are you sure you really need a new room, can't this," she looks you up down again, "go somewhere else?"
[[Stay Quiet-&gt;Peaceful Leah]]
[[Get angry-&gt;Angry Leah]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="Peaceful Leah" tags="" position="677,1495" size="100,100">You stay quiet and Devil speaks up, "Just give us the damn key already."
Leah sighs again and reaches back and grabs a key from behind her, "Since you are so keen you can give them the tour."
"We will," Natasha snatches the key from Leah's hand.
Devil looks at the clock on the wall, "I can't stick around for the tour sorry my dude but Natasha will help you out."
[[Thank you for everything Devil.-&gt;The tour]]

Leah glares at you. She reaches behind herself and grabs a key and throws it at you before getting up and walking off.
Devil laughs behind you.
"Thank you," Natasha calls out from behind you.
Devil looks at the clock on the wall, "ah shit I can't stick around for the tour guys."
Thank you for everything you've done

[[Thank you for everything you've done-&gt;The tour]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="The tour" tags="" position="869,1508" size="100,100">Devil waves at you as she walks to the lift.
Natasha smiles at you, "So I'm going to keep it short because you look pretty tired but simply, welcome to the Hotel. There are 1000 floors going up and 1000 basement floors. But most of what you'll need will be on the first five. This is the ground level," she starts to walk and points to a grand set of double doors, "that is the library, I recommend checking it out if you want to learn more about your abilites and this world."
She walks into the lift and one wall is indeed covered in buttons. It would be a strain to get the higher ones.
"Level 1 is a meeting hall, not important right now," she presses L2.
The lift takes you up and the doors open with a ding.
This is a vast floor. A huge gym spans in front of you. Spaces for people to practise fighting, all kinds of arenas and obstacle courses. But also weapon racks are every where. That's what makes it so different to any kind of gym you had been to. All kinds of people are training in various ways. There are also two rooms at the back.
Natasha steps out onto the floor, you follow her. She walks to the rooms at the back, "This is the forge," she points to the bigger room, "I reccommend going there to get some form of weapon. The other is a magic room which only magic users are allowed in."
You can feel heat coming off the forge.
Natasha walks to one of the open areas and beckons you to follow, "So we don't have any werewolves or any other kind of wereanimal at the hotel but I think I understand the shifting process."
You follow her and look around. No one is looking at you despite what you are wearing.
"If you shift we will see what kind of big cat you are," she explains, "So from what I read you have to imagine yourself changing and shifting. I guess because we don't know which cat you are just picture any one."
You close your eyes and picture the shift.

"So it works the same in reverse," Natasha explains.

"That was amazing," You say.
She nods and leads you back into the lift. She presses L3.
The lift opens to a hall of dining tables, "This is where we eat, not that interesting."
She presses L4 and the lift opens to a long corridor. It goes on for as far as you can see. And there are lots of doors. Natasha steps out of the lift.
"So this is where everyone's rooms are. Now I will warn you not to go wandering down there, even though it's straight you will get lost."
She hands you your key and walks down the hallway until she comes across a doorway with your name on it.
"Here you are," She smiles, "now get some rest I know you need it. Tomorrow go check out one of the places I showed you."
She smiles at you and walks off.

On the bed there are a change of clothes.

You push open the doors. It is a huge library, shelves filled with books from ceiling to floor and it seems the shelves go on forever.
Sitting at a table studying is Natasha. She looks up as the doors close behind you.
"Good morning," she smiles, "I picked out a few books that might interest you."
There is a pile of books in front of her.

"Good monring," you reply.
"What are you doing here?" she asks.
"I'm going to get a weapon," you reply.
"Yeah nah that makes sense. Look I'll introduce you," she fans herself a little then grabs your wrist and drags you over to the room you remember Natasha described as the Forge.
Devil pushes open the door with all her body weight and it swings open.
Heat hits you right away.
There is a huge man banging away over the roaring fire.
"Hey, Harry got anything for this newbie?" She calls out.
He looks up from his work and wipes his hands on a flithy rag.
"Sure do," he brings you over to the opposite side of the forge where all kinds of weapons made out of all kinds of materials are laying. Some more magical than others.
"You can pick any of them, I recomend the steel for beginners though," he says.
You look at all the weapons, curiously.
"They're a werecat you know?" Devil tells Harry.
"Oh a werecat, I heard werecats only connect with one type of weapon but as soon as they pick it up they can use it like a pro," Harry smiles at you, "I'm excited to see what you choose."

They were designed to be beautiful and fierce. They were designed by the goddesses, made by Hephaestus out of marble and brought to life by Pan. The six cats were created and Pan was given the job of making sure that six remained.

Natasha looks at you when you open it, "be careful with that one, it was really hard to dig up."
You open it, carefully.
Werecats were made to be indestructable. The only metal that can harm them is bronze, as when they were carved a bronze blade was used. But they are weak to magic. Magical attacks are best avoided.
In human form the werecat will have the heighted abilites as their cat allows, strength, speed, senses. Also they are able to shift parts of their bodies, for example claws, or ears.
As you are reading someone busts into the library. You look up from the book. There is a girl you can only describe as blue standing there.
"(text-colour:#585cfe)[Natasha!]" she screams, her voice is very high pitched, it hurts your ears.
This girl standing before you is wearing all blue, head to toe... on which she is wearing incredibly high heels. Her makeup is blue, her hair is blue, her eyes are blue and even her skin is blue. However Natasha's expression darkens and she takes this girl incredibly seriously and stands to attention.
"What is it, what's going on?" Natasha asks.
"(text-colour:#585cfe)[The vampires! They're going to attack a primary school,]" she squeals.
Natasha gets up and walks to the girl to comfort her, "it's ok Maxina we'll take care of it."
"(text-colour:#585cfe)[We need to be quick they're moving in fast!]" Maxina cries.
Natasha looks to you, "Will you help?"
The sense of adventure is strong now you have learnt a little more.

This tells the story of Leland Csorba, an elf. The last elf. Vampires wanted to take over and change the world to be more vampire friendly, meaning mortals being farmed for their blood. The Elves were their biggest threat being earth's guardians. So the vampires wiped them out. Leland had been trapped in a caved in dwarven city for thousands of years. He was dug up in the 70s by a mining company in Western Australia and quickly found out by the vampires. But escaped with the help of a werewolf named Wren and a mutant mortal named Zaira but not without being tracked down by the vampires. He travelled all over the world, convinced that he was the only one who could find the elves but with no luck. They were all gone. Only the bioluminscent plant life that would grow around elven cities remained. And the vampires tracked him down and killed him. But his companions mourned him. Blake, a witch returned to the cave he had been trapped within and she found his presense was still there in the bioluminscent plant life that grew. She was able to cast a spell to bring him back. The true immortality of elves was discovered and Leland revived them. The elves of Victoria took one look at the forests to the east and were disgusted, in an instant they claimed back the suburbs to the east for the forest. And it is said somewhere within the forest Leland still resides.

Before Zeus created humans the Fae walked the earth. Children of Gaia. Elves, mermaids, fairies, unicorns, golbins and dwarves. After with humans came many myths, werewolves, a curse given to Lycaon, demons a myth born from the darkness in the souls of mortals. Vampires were created as a soulless answer to the many that swamped Hades after the creation of the short lived mortals. Then came the Pheonix from Apollo to attempt rid the world of the plague of vampires. Along with many mutations of the mortal soul, including magic.
Strangely there is no mention of werecats in this book.

Maxina leads you both out of the Hotel and down the suburban street, she's running and is surprizingly fast despite the heels. You run to keep up with her.
"I don't think I explained this before but I have I guess what you would probably like to call 'super powers'," Natasha explains as she is running, "Super speed, flight, invisablity and I can pass through solid objects but I have very brittle bones, they are hollow, like a bird's so I can't afford to take a hit from anyone."
"(text-colour:#6154fe)[I'm a water and ice witch,]" Maxina explains, somehow you are completely unsuprized by that fact.
You turn the corner and there is a primary school with children playing in the yard. 
Maxina ducks around the edge of it and runs into the forest behind it. You follow her.
"(text-colour:#6154fe)[They are not far away,]" Maxina explains.
"I'll scout ahead, you two stay here and defend the school, I'll take out as many as I can," Natasha draws a dagger from her big platform boot, starts hovering. She winks at you and then completely disappears.
Maxina looks at you, "(text-colour:#6154fe)[You're a weresomething aren't you? Can you like sense them?]"

All clear.
You look back over to Maxina and Natasha.
Maxina has healed Natasha, you can see her small frame breathing again. Maxina looks exhausted. She stands up and sprays a cascade of ice over a group of vampires.

You come to a river.
There is a log over the banks which the vampire uses to cross. It's pretty small though.

Even though everything is foreign to you, your tiger body is able to crush branches and bark underfoot... or underpaw so you aren't in any danger of tripping. But still it's so difficult to gain on him at all.
As you keep running you start to notice the trees have less and less leaves, the sun is able to poke through more. And there is no moss, shrubs or any kind of plant life. 
Eventually there is nothing but dead trees around. They look like husks of their former selves.
It gives you a bad feeling.
Every cell in your body tells you to turn around.
But the vampire is still running in a certian direction.
It's much easier to run here and you start to gain on him. You push yourself even further to try and get closer to him.

It's quiet here, no birds in the trees or any signs of life coming from the castle.
It's unnerving.
But you can't help but walk towards it.

You peek your head around to see a girl you can only describe as blue.
This girl standing before you is wearing all blue, head to toe... on which she is wearing incredibly high heels. Her makeup is blue, her hair is blue, her eyes are blue and even her skin is blue. However despite this girl's crazy appearence Devil seems to take her some what seriously. Though she does seem to be a little annoying Devil is holding back, out of respect possibly.
"What's wrong Maxina?" Devil's brow furrows.
Maxina clicks her tongue, "(text-colour:blue)[I hate that you only assume that I come to see you because something is wrong. But like anyway there is something important happening that we totally need to deal with.]"
"So there is something wrong."

"We have our own personal entry, isn't that nice," Devil tells you while drawing her two swords.
You grip your own sword tightly. You have no idea what to expect.
The lift doors open to a rough hewn tunnel. It's really dark down there but you find that you can see. 
The three of you step out of the lift and into the tunnel.
Fire appears in Devil's hand.

Devil smirks at you and keeps walking.
You follow behind. 
This would be a lot more scary if you weren't with these too.
The flickering light of the flame really shows off the texture of these walls, you can tell they weren't dug with machinary or rather any machinary you've ever seen.
After only a few minutes of walking there is light at the end of the tunnel. Haha.
Maxina walks faster toward it and the flame in Devil's hand desappears. When you catch up to Maxina you can see she looks relieved.
As you walk to the end of the tunnel it takes a while for your eyes to adjust to the bright light.
When your eyes adjust you can barely believe what you can see.
It is a city underground. There is a massive doomed ceiling over it all, with what seems like a projection of the sky and a massive fiery glowing sun in the centre. At the very end of the city there is a palace carved into the edge of the cave. The city you could spend forever looking at. There are so many different types of buildings, some are crumbling and look ancient and right next to some of those there are building so funturistic you can't concieve how they were built and there are all kinds of buildings inbetween. There are lots of people walking through the streets. They all look so unique, lots of wild hair colours and armour, so much armour, people wearing long skirts, robes and armour so small it looks like a bikini. So much variety of people.
You could stand there all day but Maxina walks down the stairs onto the street of this magical city and you have to follow. You notice there are sereval other enterances.
As you step onto the pavement of the city you notice that it is the same as the Melbourne you know, the smooth dark bluestone that makes up those busy streets, but who copied who?
You can't take it in for long because Maxina darts across the street.
"(text-colour:blue)[They used the Dandenong creek enterance,]" Maxina tells you as you are following.
She breaks into a sprint as she follows the wall of the carven around, you pass one enterance then another. She comes to a stop in front of the third one.
"(text-colour:blue)[Here,]" she starts walking up the stairs you follow her.
As you walk into the tunnel fire appears in Devil's hand.
"(text-colour:blue)[I can hear them,]" Maxina whispers.
She holds hold her hands and a ball of water appears between them she spreads it out thin, freezes it and breaks it. Sharp shards of ice float between her hands.
Devil draws her twin swords and moves the fire from her palm to the blades.

She walks through the tunnel and you come out on Chapel street right across the road from a beautiful and grand pub. The exit was merely a door way in the side of a building. So unnoticable but yet there in plain sight.
"Is this it?" You ask Devil.
Devil laughs, "I'm not taking a werecat to a pub."
Devil leads you down the street.
It's nice to hear the sound of the tram going past again, people chatting outside cafes and walking their dogs. It all feels so normal.
Devil leads you down a laneway and grabs your wrist, "trust me."

THE FULL MOON CLUB
Devil walks in and you follow but something catches your eye, or rather someone.
A woman with deep dark brown hair. 
From your dream!
She is talking to a woman with long golden brown hair. That woman looks over at you and her piercing highlighter green eyes lock onto you.
[[Approach them-&gt;Zara and Medusa]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="127" name="Zara and Medusa" tags="" position="826,1828" size="100,100">You walk over to them.
It's undeniable this is the woman from your dream. She smiles at you, "Hello, I'm Medusa."
You introduce yourself.
"Zara," the other one says and she sizes you up.
Medusa puts her hand on your shoulder, "Don't worry I'm not THE Medusa. I'm a werecat and I have reason to believe you are too. Welcome to the Pride."
Medusa pulls up her sleave to show the silhouette of the black cat.
Zara pulls down her shirt to show the mark across her collar bone.
You show yours on you shoulder.
You have found the place you belong.
