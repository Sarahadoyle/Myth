# MYTH
Myth is a choose your own adventure story built using twine. 
It rips you from normal streets of Melbourne and throws you into the unfamiliar mythical and magical world that is lurking just beneath the surface.
There is a lot of adventure to be had, fun characters to talk to and mysteries to uncover within the story. 
From encounters with gods, fights with demons and an underground city there are so many different paths to follow and places to visit. 
Though do be careful the mythical world is not without its dangers.
